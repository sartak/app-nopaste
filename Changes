            -l/--lang for setting the language to something other than Perl
            -c/--chan for setting the channel, so pastebots auto-announce

        App::Nopaste will now look at environment variables instead of nopaste
        Better handling of weird argument counts to nopaste
        If $NOPASTE_NICK is unavailable, use $USER
        Fix dependency declarations
        Default error handler now includes service name

        Use #!/usr/bin/perl instead of #!/usr/bin/env perl so M:I replaces it
